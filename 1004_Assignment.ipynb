think it warmed up even with the heat on until the next day .\\n56

the morning which got you off to a great start for the day .\\n58

                                             Nothing disappointed us about our stay and we didn\\u0092t even take advantage of the free wine tasting between 5, 6pm .\\n61

                                       Another great thing about the hotel is that every day, they offer wine and beer from 5, 6pm for free for all hotel guests .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                      Then we picked up the free lobby coffee and the WSJ and the USA Today newspapers, thus having a cheap breakfast .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                 We particularly enjoyed the nightly 'manager's reception' when wine and nibbles are freely available !\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                      The nightly free wine reception is a great way to meet people and find out what is worth seeing and what is not .\\n68

are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n70                                                                                                                                                   The staff were friendly and the free coffee and biscoti each morning and wine at 6pm each evening were occassions when one could meet other guests .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                      The hotel provides free hot drinks and biscotti in the mornings, which was good quality but why ?\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Free wine and mingle from 5 to 6pm .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                          It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                   There was a free wine tasting that the hotel put on that we were, unfortunately, too jet, lagged to participate in .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                    Every evening 5pm to 6pm, guests are invited to have free wine in the

             It is very convenient to the Gloucester Road tube stop, grocery store, drug store and fast food places .\\n17

                           The location is just around the corner from the tube, Boots and Waitrose   right next door, close to many restaurants including fast food if you like .\\n19                                                                                                                                              Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n20

beginning to run low we went down at 9 .\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                               There were Italian, Indian, British, American fast food, and Thai restaurants very close to the hotel on Cromwell   Gloucester Rds .\\n22

but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n23

minutes away to save money .\\n24

foods .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate on evening once at the Garfunkels pub in the mall, it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service .\\n28

                                      Not exactly what most tourists are looking for but when you have been out of the states as long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance !\\n30

 There is no mini, fridge in standard rooms, so you can't store any food ,  the hotel used to have mini, fridges .\\n31

restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so lukewarm food and very busy .\\n36

                   If you like Indian food we ate at the Dehli Brassiere it was exellent and more reasonably priced .\\n42

price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .\\n45                                                                 Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do !\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                as for the continental breakfast taste was good but became boring after the 3rd day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

inception I upgraded from beta to RC to finally RTM and I can tell you right now it is fast and reliable .\\n109

                          I am very happy with the program, it is much faster, I upgraded from Windows xp, the bad part is there is no driver available to install for my HP wireless printer to work

excellent .\\n100   my first fill up was 26 mpg mixed city and hwy I only expect it to get better, steering is tight and precise, only complaints are road noise is more than i like but its livable, rain or just dew pours in right on top of the power window controls when the window is cracked, but window guards have fixed that, its a fun car to drive, and for what it is, its comfortable, controls are great, easy to reach, I'm looking forward to a lot of great miles with this car .\\n101

                                           The hotel is shaped like a triangle from the sky, and this strange shape combined with the location of the elevator shafts made many rooms quite noisy .\\n14

                                         The interior of the guest rooms is decidedly generic, lacking the style of some of Chicago's newer hotels   .\\n91

some upgrading to be considered anywhere near a 4 5 star hotel .\\n107

                        The decor of the rooms and the communal areas is really dated, looks like it hasn't been touched for years .\\n109

rest, with extremely comfortable beds, and high quality bedding .\\n110                                                                                                                 We had a pretty bad view on the 27th floor relative to the other rooms which faced Lake Michigan   There's some construction right now Southwards and we stared at a giant mud pit with big cranes the entire visit

even though the service stinks, the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs, the rooms make up for it .\\n112

don\\u0092t seem to have the same dependable amenities that the Swissotel has .\\n113

the views .\\n114                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The beds were extremely comfortable, rooms were extremely spacious and the bathrooms were as well .\\n115

was one of the nicest and most importantly cleanest they'd been in lately .\\n116                                                                                                                                                       From talking to other guests, I concluded that rooms ending with numbers xx1, xx2, xxx19 and xx20 should be avoided unless you enjoy listening to elevators going up and down !\\n117                                                                                                                                                                                                                  One thing that struck me as backward is that they charge $10 per 24 hours of internet usage in certain guest rooms .\\n118

had used the conference facilities as well as several hotel rooms .\\n119

                                                        Then we were told that rooms on the top 5 or 6 floors are all non, smoking .\\n121

However, when we arrived at our room there was a maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38

                           The room was large and very comfortable with a nice large bathroom .\\n39

arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43

adequate with thick, fluffy towels .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                                                                 The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54

remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

had several problems .\\n56

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n58

bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

the bathroom .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                               We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\n61

did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n63

Arches National Park Garmin's route is 40 mins shorter on a 7 hour drive because it chooses shorter route along minor highways instead of longer route along I, 70 with higher speed limit .\\n13

beware that Garmin expects you to drive with a speed close to speed limit along NYC streets .\\n14

                                                               I have noticed that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .\\n25                                                                                                                                 I can see that this could at some point become out of date if the governing authority changes the speed limit on a particular road, but it is a cool function nonetheless .\\n26

passed by !\\n38                    I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n39

        From what I have seen as far as the speed limit issue is that it is off only by 5mph, but dead on in other places .\\n41

speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n43                                                                                 I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n44

display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n35

enlarge or shrink the screen .\\n36              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n37

                                                                                                                                                                                               you can either move the screen to eliminate the glare, or move the lamp .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I'd far rather have this beautifully crisp screen and make the occasional adjustment for glare, than deal with a matte screen 24 7 .\\n46

doesn't tilt back far enough .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              yeah, you'd probably want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .\\n48                                                            And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\n49

                                                                                                                                                                                 Except for difficulties seeing the entire New York Times crossword puzzle all at once on the screen, the Asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old IBM laptop .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I was also nervous about the fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Also considered lower, end 14, 15  screens for use of the DVD .\\n53

     The screen is too small for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .\\n55

anything more than just satisfying from a purchase standpoint .\\n56

of a problem in some lighting conditions .\\n57

sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice

                                                 I also needed Web connectivity for research, a screen with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasn't too cramped .\\n92

feature of expanding zooming the presentation on the screen is a nice feature, but I have to admit having never needing to use it   .\\n94

                                Yes, screen is small, video card is weak, and keyboard is cramped, but this is the case for other netbooks at this price point .\\n134

life but from what iv seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running wifi and other applications with around half screen brightness .\\n135

The only minor issue that I have with 1005HA is that it does not allow the screen to rotate further .\\n137

able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n139

getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural

fingerprint magnet, limited screen tilt, tinny speakers, and intermittent odd glitches, I still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if I were on the market for a netbook .\\n144

              This machine is plenty fast, it's just that if I try to do work with it ,  my office's order entry system as displayed on the netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .\\n162

to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\n163

                                         Could be better and don't use the highest resolution unless you want all of your stuff to have the wrong aspect ration on the screen It flattens it to make more visible .\\n165

standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\n169

setting that lets you  compress  the screen which makes everything smaller and allows you to fit more on the screen .\\n170

it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\n171

                 As others have noted, I wish the screen wasn't so reflective .\\n172

because the price was so good but got a great room on the 16th floor facing the London Eye .\\n53

                                                  Another word of warning when booking through the Holiday Inn website ,  VAT was NOT included in the price at the time of booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying \\u00a317 more per night than I'd expected

                           The shower pressure was a bit low but that's the price you pay for the top floor and it was well worth it  ,  Instead of minibar there was an empty fridge which came quite handy for our own beverages, I doubt they would have milk in their minibar  ,  Tea and coffee making facilites and iron with board were a great bonus to what we had expected from our room .\\n91

            Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n5

back with sleek stainless steel .\\n6                                                                                                                 Frankly, I never used either the card slot or changed the battery on my Kindle 1 but I liked that they were there and I miss them on the Kindle 2, even though, I have to admit, I don't actually need them .\\n7

to charge the Kindle in the car if you have a battery charger with a USB port   .\\n8                                                                                                                  You can't carry an extra battery ,  though with the extended battery life and extra charging options it's almost a non, issue ,  and you can't replace the battery because of the iPod, like fixed backing .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       For one thing, there's no charge except battery power no pun intended !\\n10   Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                As for the battery, Amazon's explanation was that it'd thicken the Kindle, so I'm fine with it b c the slenderness of the K2 is such a plus .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                         Short battery life ,  I charged this thing for a couple of hours, 24 hours ago ,  it's still running and just at 75% of full power .\\n13

way around the thing .\\n14

that immediately addressed me by my nickname, no log, in necessary, and could have begun downloading whatever I wanted over the 3G Whispernet within seconds as the battery was charging,\\n17

battery life was perfectly fine .\\n19

saves on the battery .\\n55

                       The Kindle does not come with a UK power adaptor, so that has been an extra \\u00a312 expense, but I could charge the battery using the computer and USB cable .\\n76

                                      Everyone looking into the Kindle has probably heard about the font smoothing contrast issue which is exacerbated by the bright whiteness of the unit's housing

problem, and I've already put a  skin  on mine so that the contrast between the ePaper display's gray background and the  frame's  white is no longer an issue .\\n56

and when reading the Kindle, for some reason, that little blurry spot does not show up, and this is at a small font .\\n57

                                       On I, 76 in PA, I travelled through a mile long tunnel and it tracked me perfectly even though it obviously could not get satellite signals inside the tunnel

guess it loss contact with the satellites due to interferrence by the tall buildings arroung .\\n13                   Can pay like $200 or something and get the service for life, HotFix which allows it to get satellites much faster when booting up this is a great feature and my only complaint about past Garmins that I used which was that it took too long to acquire satellites, this eliminates

                             But unlike my previous Garmin, the satellite acquisition is very fast, and recalculation when I deviate from the stated route is almost immediate .\\n36

   Bottom line is I wanted a unit that is accurate and had reliable satellite connection .\\n37

                                              I have noticed no problems with this unit's ability to detect satellites .\\n39                                                                                                                         It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n40

read up on the gadget so there may be features I don't know about, but just have to link it up to the satellites and off you go .\\n46

                                                                                                                                                                    I plugged this into my van's lighter socket turned it on and it found the satellites in about 5 seconds while inside my garage .\\n56

connection .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                               Took a few minutes for the unit to link up with the satellite, but once that was done, it was a breeze .\\n58

signals, holding it up to the sky, outdoors .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                                        My only complaints so far is that the gps loses satellite reception often and confuses itself .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                                         It's fast in aquiring satellites and fast in entering addresses with a minimum of keystrokes .\\n61
